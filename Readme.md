# Scryfall Card Consumer 

This is a very basic scryfall card consumer for putting cards into a MongoDB streamed from my Scryfall Kafka
Connect application. It is set up to use the default settings for a MongoDB docker. Change the settings for 
your database. 

Changes I'd like to make is to set the ID in the database to that of the card from scryfall.
